QAccessibilityClient
====================

This library is used when writing accessibility clients such as screen readers.

Coding style: http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style
Generally this library follows http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Library_Code_Policy

Be aware that it is in an early stage of development right now so no compatibility is guaranteered.

All public API is in:
src/qaccessibilityclient

The abstraction of DBus and related at-spi tools should go into
src/atspi
but not exported.

You can generate documentation (see docs folder README).

Using CMAKE with QAccessibilityClient
=====================================
Do NOT write a Find*.cmake file! It just works the way it is (TM).

Use:
  find_package(QAccessibilityClient)
or if you use feature logging something like this:
  macro_optional_find_package(QAccessibilityClient)
  macro_log_feature(QAccessibilityClient_FOUND "qaccessibilityclient" "KDE client-side accessibility library" "https://projects.kde.org/libkdeaccessibilityclient" FALSE "" "Required to enable ATSPI feature.")

  include_directories(${QACCESSIBILITYCLIENT_INCLUDE_DIR})
  target_link_libraries(targetname ${QACCESSIBILITYCLIENT_LIBRARY})

In your code include <qaccessibilityclient/accessibleobject.h> etc.
