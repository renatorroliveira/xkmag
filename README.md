XKMag
=====

The Extended K Magnifier. I decided to create this project motivated by some factors, such as:

- The inexistence of feedback at the KDE Bug tracking system for the KMag.
- The feature of top/left/right/bottom screen mode was removed in KDE 4 and even with feature requests (4 years ago i posted a request on the bug tracking of KDE) no response was given to users.
- Some development decisions in the development of KMag are, to say friendly, "lame".
- I looked at the code of KMag, there are files that isn't updated since version 0.x, the tool is already at 4.12.3 version.
- The best version of KMag is the 3.5.10, but this version uses old libraries and Qt 3, for modern Linux distributions the dependencies are not available and conflict with KDE 4 libs. So, lets port the 3.5.10 removed features to tge 4.12 code.
- The 4.12 has some interesting features too, like the keyboard focus following.

My final objective is to obtain an application similar to the Window native Manifier, that is already awesome since Windows 2000. I always tought that is a shame in 2014 (15 years later) the Linux don't have a decent magnifying tool, like the Windows' one.

I say all this things in the context of a disabled person, someone with vision deficiency (like me). I have around 30% of a normal person vision and the magnifying tool is eesential for me. I use it in all my tasks with a computer, so i need a godd tool.

Anyone that wants to contribute and develop this tool with the objective of supporting disabled people is welcome to join the project.
